# Hüma Browser

Hüma is a native and open source web browser. Developed based on Firefox, this browser stands out with its privacy-oriented design and customizable features. In addition to its own theme, Hüma offers features such as Hüma Explorer, which makes it easy to navigate between pages, vertical tab support, Hüma History and Mythology pages that work without internet, Hüma Bulut, which has a 10MB limit for file sharing, and Hüma Betik, a scripting tool with Turkish syntax. Aiming to contribute to the Pardus ecosystem, Hüma also includes information about Turkish mythology and history

## The Process of the Hüma Project?

The Hüma project started in 2022 when Egehan built the first web browser using Python and the QtWebEngine engine. This browser, called "VastSea Browser", was not suitable for daily use as it was a simple and experimental project. Later on, various experimental projects were developed, but they were smaller and less complex. In 2023, when Egehan learned that there was a competition for Pardus at Teknofest, he thought of making a powerful browser for Pardus. However, it was postponed due to the difficulty of developing a browser with the Chromium project. During this period, he developed a project called "Missile Package Installer", but the project was suspended due to technical problems. Meanwhile, the idea of Hüma was born again.

Hüma was started to be researched by Egehan KAHRAMAN in January 2024. In February, with the cancellation of the failed Missile Package Loader project, he started working on making this idea a reality. First, a version written in the Electron framework was developed, but thinking that this would not be enough, he simultaneously tried to grasp the concept of making a Firefox-based browser. After about two months of research and development, the first version of Firefox, compiled from source code, appeared in February 2024. On March 27, 2024, it began to be redeveloped as a fork of the Firefox browser, taking the first step towards its main goal of becoming a Firefox fork.

As of May 2024, Egehan is working hard to make Hüma stable and unique and aims to bring this project to the Pardus ecosystem. At the same time, this browser, which has the mission and vision of being the first Turkish web browser, continues its development by adopting high goals.

## 15 JUNE 2024 HÜMA ARTICLE:

This project was a fairly simple experiment using QtWebEngine in December 2022 and January 2023. At that time my goal was just to do something experimental and learn a bit more about Python. Until September 2023 I didn't add anything, but then I realized that the Turks didn't have a web browser; there was only a browser for Android (not sure if it was open source, I think it was closed source). With this in mind, I wanted to make a Turkish browser that would not only be in Turkish, but would also be a project that would provide internet-free access to those who wanted to research Turkish mythology and history.

I was very particular about adding something original to the project. I didn't want to just change the name of Chromium or Firefox and add two logos, so I started to add various features to the browser. First there was a browser using Electron, which was going to be the first stable version of Hüma under the name Anka. I developed this version until March, but I changed the name Anka to Hüma because the name Anka was used everywhere and known by everyone. Hüma was a bird that I had learned about while researching our mythology. Hüma is referred to as the bird of paradise; it flies in paradise and sometimes appears to humans. It is believed that the people Hüma passes over will be exalted and ascend to the throne. So, eventually the name Anka was changed to Hüma.

I wanted to make a Firefox-based browser from the beginning, but it was better to start with Electron. While developing the Electron-based version, I tried to compile Firefox. At first I couldn't successfully compile any Firefox fork. However, when I stopped focusing on the Electron-based version, I put all my effort into Firefox and eventually learned how to compile and package it. Later on, I added features that were already in the Electron-based version to this version, and eventually I successfully completed the first demonstrations of our first native web browser.

Currently Hüma's main features are:

* Own Theme:** Comes installed by default.
* Hüma Explorer:** is the default add-on for Hüma. Hüma Explorer is used to navigate through the browser's pages and Hüma's sub-projects, to easily access bookmarks.
** **Hüma Tabs:** Vertical tab feature
**Hüma History and Hüma Mythology:** These pages are a web-free encyclopedia that introduces our mythology and history. The pages are kept in the browser.
* Hüma Cloud:** This is a cloud system developed for the Hüma browser. Files can be moved, currently the limit is 10MB per file.
** **Hüma Betik:** A web interpreter for those who want to write scripts with Turkish syntax. It runs on the web and currently only supports single line scripting.

Hüma is not completely finished at the moment as it aims to be a large-scale project. Hüma is open source and free software. There is currently no official website (soon to be completed and published).

Another sub-project of Hüma is Ak Ana (Ak Ana was a name I thought of before the name Hüma; Ak Ana is a goddess who gives God the idea of creation). Ak Ana is an alternative to the PWA method, which allows us to download websites like WhatsApp, for example. PWA is a feature that is currently missing in Firefox, and with Ak Ana I aimed to provide this PWA.
